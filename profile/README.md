# üöÄ Spring Loaded Bootcamp üöÄ
Welcome to an exciting, hands-on workshop where we'll dive deep into building modern, distributed applications with Spring Boot! Get ready to explore cutting-edge technologies, build interactive services, and see your code come alive in a dynamic, observable environment.

## üéØ Workshop Goals
By the end of this full-day intensive session, you'll have built a robust application that demonstrates:

- Microservices in Action: Deploying and managing multiple Spring Boot services with Docker Compose.
- Centralized Configuration: Managing application settings with Spring Cloud Config Server and seeing live updates via RabbitMQ.
- Intelligent Routing: Directing traffic with Spring Cloud Gateway, including advanced techniques like weighted routing for canary deployments.
- Modular Design: Structuring your applications with Spring Modulith for clear boundaries and externalized eventing using RabbitMQ.
- Data Persistence: Interacting with Redis v8 using Spring Data Redis.
- Identity & Security: Securing your applications with Spring Security and OAuth2 (GitHub).
- AI-Powered Insights: Integrating Spring AI to perform real-time sentiment analysis on user input.
- Deep Observability: Gaining insights into your application's health and performance with Loki, Grafana, and distributed tracing.
- Real-time Metrics: "Calling home" to a central server to capture live metrics from your distributed applications.
- Production Ready: Exposing your local applications to the internet with Ngrok for interactive demos.

## ‚ú® What We're Building: The "Social Pulse Tracker"
Imagine an app where people can submit short messages, comments, or votes on a topic you define. Your "Social Pulse Tracker" will collect these inputs, analyze their sentiment using AI, store them in Redis, and report live metrics back to a central dashboard. You'll expose your unique tracker via Ngrok and invite your social media contacts to interact, making the workshop truly memorable!
